# YouTube Clone
- To improve on my frontend skills, I tasked myself with cloning YouTubeâ€™s frontend to the best extent I can and came up with this end product.
- I have tried to implement various CSS properties to this project to learn about it like Grid, Flex, Position etc.

## Live Demo
This project is hosted live [here](http://priyankasaini.rf.gd/youtube-clone/)

### The Page is Responsive
I have used Media Queries along with some CSS to make the site responsive so that it looks good on small screens(like Mobile Phones)<br>
